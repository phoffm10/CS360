<pre>
- Go over src/iptr.c in detail.  
  Kill the comments and perhaps comment
  the end of each print statement.  
  Examine the output in detail.
  Make sure you highlight the pointer arithmetic.

- Briefly go over cptr and dptr.
- Go over sptr in detail -- especially the pointer lines.

Do Little Quiz if you have time.  Use the open office.
   Otherwise, tell them to go over
   it on their own.    Maybe do a video lecture of it.

There's really nothing new in this small lecture - just some reinforcement 
from the last lecture.
<hr>

We've used pointers in CS140 and CS302.  If you want some review, 
please see
<a href=http://web.eecs.utk.edu/~jplank/plank/classes/cs140/Notes/Pointers/index.html>
pointer lecture notes from CS140</a>.  For additional reinforcement, I have a 
set of <a href=http://web.eecs.utk.edu/~jplank/plank/classes/cs302/Notes/Kurt/>old 
lecture notes from CS302 where I set up more STL data structures
that point to each other with pointers.</a>
Both of these are in C++.
<p>
There is no standard template library in C.  This means that vectors, lists, sets
and maps are gone.  We will replace all of them in the next few lectures.  We'll
start with vectors.  In C, we use arrays instead of vectors.  You can statically
declare an array by putting <b>[size]</b> in the variable declaration.  For example,
the following variable declaration will create an array <b>iarray</b> of ten integers:

<p><center><table border=3 cellpadding=3><td><pre>
int iarray[10];
</pre></td></table></center><p>

You can access the elements of <b>iarray</b> in square brackets.  Unlike C++, <b>iarray</b>
has no methods.  In particular, the size of <b>iarray</b> is not stored anywhere -- you
have to keep track of it yourself.
<p>
In reality, <b>iarray</b> is a pointer to the first element of the array.  In other words,
there are 40 bytes allocated for the array (since integers are four bytes each),
and <b>iarray</b> points to the first of these.  If we want, we can set a second pointer
to <b>iarray</b>, and we can print the elements of <b>iarray</b> by incrementing the 
pointer and dereferencing it.  We do all of that in 
<b><a href=src/iptr.c>src/iptr.c</a></b>:

<p><center><table border=3 cellpadding=3><td><pre>
<font color=blue>/* This program sets a pointer to an array, and then dereferences each of the
   elements of the array using the pointer and pointer arithmetic.  It prints
   the pointers in hexadecimal while it does so. */</font>

#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;
#include &lt;stdlib.h&gt;

typedef unsigned long (UL);

int main()
{
  int iarray[10];
  int *ip;
  int i;

  <font color=blue>/* Set the 10 elements of iarray to be 100 to 109, and print the array's address. */</font>

  for (i = 0; i &lt; 10; i++) iarray[i] = 100+i;
  printf("iarray = 0x%lx\n", (UL) iarray);

  <font color=blue>/* Set ip equal to array, and then print the 10 elements using both iarray and ip.
     The following quantities will be printed for each element:

      - The index i (goes from 0 to 9)
      - The value of iarray[i] (goes from 100 to 109)
      - The pointer ip (will start at iarray and increment by four each time).
      - What *ip points to (this will be 100 to 109 again)
      - Pointer arithmetic: (ip-array) -- this will be the value of i.
   */</font>

  ip = iarray;

  for (i = 0; i &lt; 10; i++) {
    printf("i=%d.  ",            i              );
    printf("iarray[i]=%d.  ",    iarray[i]      );
    printf("ip = 0x%lx.  ",      (UL) ip        );
    printf("*ip=%d.  ",          *ip            );
    printf("(ip-iarray)=%ld.\n", (UL) (ip-iarray));
    ip++;
  }

  return 0;
}
</pre></td></table></center><p>

In the <b>for</b> loop, we print out five quantities -- please read the inline comments
for what gets printed.
Let's take a look at output:

<pre>
UNIX> <font color=darkred><b>bin/iptr</b></font>
iarray = 0x7fff5fbfdc40
i=0.  iarray[i]=100.  ip = 0x7fff5fbfdc40.  *ip=100.  (ip-iarray)=0
i=1.  iarray[i]=101.  ip = 0x7fff5fbfdc44.  *ip=101.  (ip-iarray)=1
i=2.  iarray[i]=102.  ip = 0x7fff5fbfdc48.  *ip=102.  (ip-iarray)=2
i=3.  iarray[i]=103.  ip = 0x7fff5fbfdc4c.  *ip=103.  (ip-iarray)=3
i=4.  iarray[i]=104.  ip = 0x7fff5fbfdc50.  *ip=104.  (ip-iarray)=4
i=5.  iarray[i]=105.  ip = 0x7fff5fbfdc54.  *ip=105.  (ip-iarray)=5
i=6.  iarray[i]=106.  ip = 0x7fff5fbfdc58.  *ip=106.  (ip-iarray)=6
i=7.  iarray[i]=107.  ip = 0x7fff5fbfdc5c.  *ip=107.  (ip-iarray)=7
i=8.  iarray[i]=108.  ip = 0x7fff5fbfdc60.  *ip=108.  (ip-iarray)=8
i=9.  iarray[i]=109.  ip = 0x7fff5fbfdc64.  *ip=109.  (ip-iarray)=9
UNIX> <font color=darkred><b></b></font>
</pre>

Everything in hex will change from machine to machine.  However, their interrelationship will
always be the same.  In the <b>for</b> loop, <b>i</b>, <b>iarray[i]</b> and <b>*ip</b>
should all be straightforward and require no explanation.  I'll explain the others in
detail.
<p>
When this program starts to run, the operating system has set it up so that the 40 bytes
starting with <tt>0x7fff5fbfdc40</tt> are where <b>iarray</b> is stored.  That is why <b>iarray</b>
is equal to <tt>0x7fff5fbfdc40</tt>.  If <b>iarray[0]</b> is the four bytes that start at
<tt>0x7fff5fbfdc40</tt>, then <b>iarray[1]</b> must be the four bytes that start at
<tt>0x7fff5fbfdc44</tt>.  This is why <b>ip</b> is equal to <tt>0x7fff5fbfdc44 </tt>on the second iteration 
of the <b>for</b> loop.
<p>
While this is all logical, it is a little confusing: adding one to <b>ip</b> actually
adds four to the value of the pointer.  
This is called "pointer arithmetic" -- when you add <i>x</i>
to a pointer, it really adds <i>sx</i> to it, where <i>s</i> is the size of data to 
which the pointer points.  
<p>
The last column printed in the <b>for</b> loop is a little confusing too.  Again, focus
on the line where <b>i</b> equals one.  <b>ip</b> is equal to <tt>0x7fff5fbfdc44</tt>, so you 
would think that <b>(ip-iarray)</b> would equal four.  It does not, because the compiler
is doing pointer arithmetic -- from the point of view of the compiler, when you 
say "<b>ip-iarray</b>," you are asking for the number of elements between <b>ip</b>
and <b>iarray</b>.  That will be the difference between the pointers, divided by the
size of the element.  In this case, it is <tt>(0x7fff5fbfdc44-0x7fff5fbfdc40)/4</tt>, 
which equals one.
<p>
To help hammer this home a little further, I have three other programs where are
nearly identical to <b>ptr.c</b>:
<p>
<UL>
<LI> <b><a href=src/cptr.c>src/cptr.c</a></b>: The array is <b>char</b>'s, so the pointer's
value is actually incremented by one on each iteration.
<LI> <b><a href=src/dptr.c>src/dptr.c</a></b>: The array is <b>double</b>'s, so the pointer's
value is actually incremented by eight on each iteration.
<LI> <b><a href=src/sptr.c>src/sptr.c</a></b>: The array is a struct of two <b>double</b>'s, so the pointer's
value is actually incremented by sixteen on each iteration.
</UL>

That last one is worth looking at it its entirety:

<p><center><table border=3 cellpadding=3><td><pre>
<font color=blue>/* This is the same as src/iptr.c, except iarray is an array of "Two" structs instead
   of ints.  The "Two" struct is simply a struct of two doubles. */</font>

#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;
#include &lt;stdlib.h&gt;

typedef struct {
  double d1;
  double d2;
} Two;

#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;
#include &lt;stdlib.h&gt;

typedef unsigned long (UL);

int main()
{
  Two iarray[10];
  Two *ip;
  int i;

  for (i = 0; i &lt; 10; i++) iarray[i].d1 = 100+i;   <font color=blue>/* Set the d1 field to be 100 + i */</font>
  for (i = 0; i &lt; 10; i++) iarray[i].d2 = 200+i;   <font color=blue>/* Set the d2 field to be 200 + i */</font>

  printf("iarray = 0x%lx\n", (UL) iarray);

  ip = iarray;

  for (i = 0; i &lt; 10; i++) {
    printf("i=%d.  ",                    i                              );
    printf("iarray[i]={%.2lf,%.2lf}.  ", iarray[i].d1, iarray[i].d2     );
    printf("ip = 0x%lx.  ",              (UL) ip                        );
    printf("*ip={%.2lf,%.2lf}.  ",       ip-&gt;d1, ip-&gt;d2                 );
    printf("(ip-iarray)=%ld.\n",         (UL) (ip-iarray)               );
    ip++;
  }

  return 0;
}
</pre></td></table></center><p>

In particular, I use the arrow to dereference different parts of the struct from the 
pointer: <b>ip-&gt;d1</b> accesses <b>d1</b>, and 
<b>ip-&gt;d2</b> accesses <b>d2</b>.  Let's take a look:

<pre>
UNIX> <font color=darkred><b>bin/sptr</b></font>
iarray = 0x7ffeed0e10f0
i=0.  iarray[i]={100.00,200.00}.  ip = 0x7ffeed0e10f0.  *ip={100.00,200.00}.  (ip-iarray)=0.
i=1.  iarray[i]={101.00,201.00}.  ip = 0x7ffeed0e1100.  *ip={101.00,201.00}.  (ip-iarray)=1.
i=2.  iarray[i]={102.00,202.00}.  ip = 0x7ffeed0e1110.  *ip={102.00,202.00}.  (ip-iarray)=2.
i=3.  iarray[i]={103.00,203.00}.  ip = 0x7ffeed0e1120.  *ip={103.00,203.00}.  (ip-iarray)=3.
i=4.  iarray[i]={104.00,204.00}.  ip = 0x7ffeed0e1130.  *ip={104.00,204.00}.  (ip-iarray)=4.
i=5.  iarray[i]={105.00,205.00}.  ip = 0x7ffeed0e1140.  *ip={105.00,205.00}.  (ip-iarray)=5.
i=6.  iarray[i]={106.00,206.00}.  ip = 0x7ffeed0e1150.  *ip={106.00,206.00}.  (ip-iarray)=6.
i=7.  iarray[i]={107.00,207.00}.  ip = 0x7ffeed0e1160.  *ip={107.00,207.00}.  (ip-iarray)=7.
i=8.  iarray[i]={108.00,208.00}.  ip = 0x7ffeed0e1170.  *ip={108.00,208.00}.  (ip-iarray)=8.
i=9.  iarray[i]={109.00,209.00}.  ip = 0x7ffeed0e1180.  *ip={109.00,209.00}.  (ip-iarray)=9.
UNIX> <font color=darkred><b></b></font>
</pre>


As you can see, the pointers are different from the run of <b>iptr</b>.  
However, their interrelationship
is the same, and each time you increment <b>ip</b>, its value is increased by 16, because
the size of the struct is 16 bytes.

<h2>Little Quiz</h2>

More pointers: 
Behold the following C program (in <a href=src/quiz.c><b>src/quiz.c</b></a>):

When you run this, the first line of output is:

<pre>
UNIX> ./quiz
ip: 0xeffff9fc, &ip: 0xeffff9cc, array: 0xeffff9d0

</pre>
What is the rest of the output?
<p>
(In class, I used the following drawing to help illustrate.  You can 
get them in <a href=img/Little-Quiz-Helper.odp>img/Little-Quiz-Helper.odp (Open Office)</a>
or <a href=img/Little-Quiz-Helper.pdf>img/Little-Quiz-Helper.pdf (PDF)</a>.)
<p>
This is tricky, but you should be able to do it with all you currently
know about pointers.  This is the kind of question I am fond of asking
on tests. Here's the answer.  If you want to make sure you're doing
things right, try to draw a picture of memory and fill in what that
first line tells you.  Here would be my picture.  We'll start with 
a blank slate with the relevant addresses from the first line of 
the program:
<p><center><table border=3 cellpadding=3><td><pre>
0xeffff9cc: |                        |
0xeffff9d0: |                        |
0xeffff9d4: |                        |
0xeffff9d8: |                        |
0xeffff9dc: |                        |
0xeffff9e0: |                        |
0xeffff9e4: |                        |
0xeffff9e8: |                        |
0xeffff9ec: |                        |
0xeffff9f0: |                        |
0xeffff9f4: |                        |
0xeffff9f8: |                        |
0xeffff9fc: |                        |
</pre></td></table></center><p>
Now, what do we know from the first line of output.  Well, the 
address of <b>ip</b> is <tt>0xeffff9cc</tt>, and its value is
<tt>0xeffff9fc</tt>.  So we can draw in its value at that address:
<p><center><table border=3 cellpadding=3><td><pre>
0xeffff9cc: | ip = 0xeffff9fc        |
0xeffff9d0: |                        |
0xeffff9d4: |                        |
0xeffff9d8: |                        |
0xeffff9dc: |                        |
0xeffff9e0: |                        |
0xeffff9e4: |                        |
0xeffff9e8: |                        |
0xeffff9ec: |                        |
0xeffff9f0: |                        |
0xeffff9f4: |                        |
0xeffff9f8: |                        |
0xeffff9fc: |                        |
</pre></td></table></center><p>
From line 9, we know that the address of <b>i</b> is equal to <b>ip</b>.
Moreover, <b>i</b>'s value is 11, so we can draw that in:
<p><center><table border=3 cellpadding=3><td><pre>
0xeffff9cc: | ip = 0xeffff9fc        |
0xeffff9d0: |                        |
0xeffff9d4: |                        |
0xeffff9d8: |                        |
0xeffff9dc: |                        |
0xeffff9e0: |                        |
0xeffff9e4: |                        |
0xeffff9e8: |                        |
0xeffff9ec: |                        |
0xeffff9f0: |                        |
0xeffff9f4: |                        |
0xeffff9f8: |                        |
0xeffff9fc: | i = 11                 |
</pre></td></table></center><p>
Now, <b>array</b> is a pointer to the first element of the 10-element
array.  Since its value is <tt>0xeffff9d0</tt>, we can draw in all ten elements
of the array:
<p><center><table border=3 cellpadding=3><td><pre>
0xeffff9cc: | ip = 0xeffff9fc        |
0xeffff9d0: | array[0] = 0           |
0xeffff9d4: | array[1] = 1           |
0xeffff9d8: | array[2] = 2           |
0xeffff9dc: | array[3] = 3           |
0xeffff9e0: | array[4] = 4           |
0xeffff9e4: | array[5] = 5           |
0xeffff9e8: | array[6] = 6           |
0xeffff9ec: | array[7] = 7           |
0xeffff9f0: | array[8] = 8           |
0xeffff9f4: | array[9] = 9           |
0xeffff9f8: |                        |
0xeffff9fc: | i = 11                 |
</pre></td></table></center><p>

Now we know all we need to know.  Since <b>&i</b> equals <b>ip</b>,
the first line of output is "<tt>&i: 0xeffff9fc.</tt>"  Next, from line
10 of the program, we know that <b>ipp</b> equals the address of
<b>ip</b>.  So the next line is:
<pre>
ipp: 0xeffff9cc, *ipp: 0xeffff9fc, **ipp: 0xb
</pre>
Note, that last word is <tt>0xb</tt>, and not 11, because we are printing 11 
in hexadecimal.
<p>
Now, since <b>a1</b> is a pointer to <b>array[1]</b>, its value is
<tt>0xeffff9d4</tt>.  Thus, our next line of output (after the blank line) is:
<pre>
a1: 0xeffff9d4, *a1: 0x1
</pre>
Finally, 
the statement ``<b>a1 += 4</b>'' is pointer arithmetic.
It sets <b>a1</b> ahead four ints.  Therefore, it adds 16 to the 
value of <b>a1</b> -- 16 because ints are 4 bytes: 4*4 = 16.  After
the statement it points to <b>array[5]</b>.  Therefore, the last line is
<pre>
0 1 2 3 4 500 6 7 8 9 
</pre>
Here is the entire output:
<p><center><table border=3 cellpadding=3><td><pre>
ip: 0xeffff9fc, &ip: 0xeffff9cc, array: 0xeffff9d0

&i: 0xeffff9fc
ipp: 0xeffff9cc, *ipp: 0xeffff9fc, **ipp: 0xb

a1: 0xeffff9d4, *a1: 0x1
0 1 2 3 4 500 6 7 8 9 
</pre></td></table></center><p>
<p>
The output can differ from machine to machine, but it is totally dependent on the

<h3>Topcoder problems that can give you practice if you do them in C</h3>

<UL>
<LI> <a href=http://web.eecs.utk.edu/~jplank/topcoder-writeups/2018/DigitStringDiv2/index.html>DigitStringDiv2</a> -- this is an easy one to give you a little string practice.
<LI> <a href=http://web.eecs.utk.edu/~jplank/topcoder-writeups/2016/EqualSubstrings2/index.html>EqualSubstrings2</a> -- practice with <b>strncmp()</b>, or perhaps with <b>strstr()</b>.
</UL>

<hr>

In C, we lose the ease of C++ strings, which is a pity. 
There are a lot of routines to help you create and manipulate strings in C.  
I go over many of them here.  One important and inconvenient thing about C strings is
that you have to manage your own memory, and that can lead to many pitfalls.  One
goal of this lecture is to help you avoid those pitfalls.

<h3>strcpy()</h3>

<pre>
char *strcpy(char *s1, const char *s2);
</pre>

<b>Strcpy()</b> assumes that <b>s2</b> is a null-terminated string,
and that <b>s1</b> is a <b>(char *)</b> with enough characters to
hold <b>s2</b>, including the null character at the end. <b>Strcpy()</b>
then copies <b>s2</b> to <b>s1</b>. It also returns <b>s1</b>.  Why
would you return your first argument?  The answer is historical -- I'll talk
about it with <b>strdup()</b>.
<p>

Here's a simple program that uses <b>strcpy()</b> to initialize
three strings and print them out (this is in 
<a href=src/strcpy.c><b>src/strcpy.c</b></a>):
<p>
For those unfamiliar with "Give Him Six!", please see 
<a href=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Ward_(broadcaster)>this,</a> 
<a href=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MJJF9_31hU>this</a> or <a href=https://www.wbir.com/article/life/people/homegrown/homegrown-tennessee-legend-john-ward/51-95533043>this</a>.

<p><center><table border=3 cellpadding=3><td><pre>
<font color=blue>/* Initialize three strings using strcpy() and print them. */</font>

#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;
#include &lt;string.h&gt;

int main()
{
  char give[5];
  char him[5];
  char six[5];

  strcpy(give, "Give");
  strcpy(him, "Him");
  strcpy(six, "Six!");

  printf("%s %s %s\n", give, him, six);
  return 0;
}
</pre></td></table></center><p>

It runs fine:
<pre>
UNIX> <font color=darkred><b>bin/strcpy</b></font>
Give Him Six!
UNIX>
</pre>
Suppose I try to copy a string that's too big.  For example, look 
at <b><a href=src/strcpy2.c>src/strcpy2.c</a></b>:

<p><center><table border=3 cellpadding=3><td><pre>
<font color=blue>/* What happens when you call strcpy and didn't allocate enough memory? */</font>

#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;
#include &lt;string.h&gt;

typedef unsigned long UL;

int main()
{
  char give[5];
  char him[5];
  char six[5];

  <font color=blue>/* Print the addresses of the three arrays. */</font>

  printf("give: 0x%lx  him: 0x%lx  six: 0x%lx\n", (UL) give, (UL) him, (UL) six);

  <font color=blue>/* This is the same as before -- nice strcpy() statements, and then print. */</font>

  strcpy(give, "Give");
  strcpy(him, "Him");
  strcpy(six, "Six!");
  printf("%s %s %s\n", give, him, six);

  <font color=blue>/* Now, this strcpy() is copying a string that is too big. */</font>

  strcpy(him, "T.J. Houshmandzadeh");
  printf("%s %s %s\n", give, him, six);

  return 0;
}
</pre></td></table></center><p>

Clearly there's a problem with this -- the string "T.J. Houshmandzadeh" is much
larger than five characters.  Some compilers, like the one on my new Macintosh, 
will compile this, but others, like
the one on my old Macintosh, will take issue with it:

<pre>
UNIX> <font color=darkred><b>gcc -o bin/strcpy2 src/strcpy2.c</b></font>
src/strcpy2.c: In function 'main':
src/strcpy2.c:21: warning: call to __builtin___strcpy_chk will always overflow destination buffer
UNIX> <font color=darkred><b></b></font>
</pre>

That's a wise compiler.  However, compilers are not all-seeing and all-knowing.  Let's fool
it by writing our own wrapper around <b>strcpy()</b> -- now it can't figure out the
problem.  
The code is in <b><a href=src/strcpy3.c>src/strcpy3.c</a></b>.

<p><center><table border=3 cellpadding=3><td><pre>
<font color=blue>/* This is the same as strcpy2.c, but I write a procedure to call strcpy(), so that
   even a smart compiler won't figure out that I have a problem. */</font>

#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;
#include &lt;string.h&gt;

typedef unsigned long UL;

void my_strcpy(char *s1, char *s2)
{
  strcpy(s1, s2);
}

int main()
{
  char give[5];
  char him[5];
  char six[5];

  printf("give: 0x%lx  him: 0x%lx  six: 0x%lx\n", (UL) give, (UL) him, (UL) six);

  strcpy(give, "Give");
  strcpy(him, "Him");
  strcpy(six, "Six!");

  printf("%s %s %s\n", give, him, six);

  my_strcpy(him, "T.J. Houshmandzadeh");

  printf("%s %s %s\n", give, him, six);
  return 0;
}
</pre></td></table></center><p>



Now run it. Your memory addresses may differ, and your output may differ, but the 
interrelationship will be the same.  I ran this in 32-bit mode on my old Mac:
<pre>
UNIX> <font color=darkred><b>bin/strcpy3</b></font>
give: 0xbfffe060  him: 0xbfffe050  six: 0xbfffe040
Give Him Six!
deh T.J. Houshmandzadeh Six!
UNIX> 
</pre>
Take a minute and try to figure out what's going on.  Look at the 
following picture of memory -- I'm drawing this in big-endian, because it makes
the character strings easier to parse.
When we start, space has been allocated
for <b>give</b>, <b>him</b> and <b>six</b>:

<pre>
                    |----4 bytes----|           
                    |               |
                    | 0 | 1 | 2 | 3 | (I'm drawing this in big endian)
               
                    |               |           
     six----------> |               | 0xbfffe040
                    |               | 0xbfffe044
                    |               | 0xbfffe048
                    |               | 0xbfffe04c
     him----------> |               | 0xbfffe050
                    |               | 0xbfffe054
                    |               | 0xbfffe058
                    |               | 0xbfffe05c
     give---------> |               | 0xbfffe060
                    |               | 0xbfffe064
                    |               | 0xbfffe068
                    |               | 0xbfffe06c
</pre>
Now, we make the first three <b>strcpy()</b> calls.  At the point of 
the first <b>printf()</b> statement, 
memory looks like:

<pre>
                    |----4 bytes----|           
                    |               |
                    | 0 | 1 | 2 | 3 | (I'm drawing this in big endian)
               
     six----------> |'S'|'i'|'x'|'!'| 0xbfffe040
                    | 0 |   |   |   | 0xbfffe044
                    |   |   |   |   | 0xbfffe048
                    |   |   |   |   | 0xbfffe04c
     him----------> |'H'|'i'|'m'| 0 | 0xbfffe050
                    |   |   |   |   | 0xbfffe054
                    |   |   |   |   | 0xbfffe058
                    |   |   |   |   | 0xbfffe05c
     give---------> |'G'|'i'|'v'|'e'| 0xbfffe060
                    | 0 |   |   |   | 0xbfffe064
                    |               | 0xbfffe068
                    |               | 0xbfffe06c
</pre>

Now, we make the call <b>strcpy(him, "T.J. Houshmandzadeh")</b>.  What happens is
that the entire string is copied to <b>him</b>, and this overruns the memory
allocated for <b>give</b>:

<pre>
                    |----4 bytes----|           
                    |               |
                    | 0 | 1 | 2 | 3 | (I'm drawing this in big endian)
               
     six----------> |'S'|'i'|'x'|'!'| 0xbfffe040
                    | 0 |   |   |   | 0xbfffe044
                    |   |   |   |   | 0xbfffe048
                    |   |   |   |   | 0xbfffe04c
     him----------> |'T'|'.'|'J'|'.'| 0xbfffe050
                    |' '|'H'|'o'|'u'| 0xbfffe054
                    |'s'|'h'|'m'|'a'| 0xbfffe058
                    |'n'|'d'|'z'|'a'| 0xbfffe05c
     give---------> |'d'|'e'|'h'| 0 | 0xbfffe060
                    | 0 |   |   |   | 0xbfffe064
                    |               | 0xbfffe068
                    |               | 0xbfffe06c
</pre>

So this means that <b>him</b> is indeed <b>"T.J. Houshmandzadeh"</b>, but
<b>give</b> has been modified as well, to be <b>"deh"</b>.  This 
accounts for the printout of:
<pre>
deh T.J. Houshmandzadeh Six!
</pre>
The bottom line is that when you modify memory that
you have not allocated (as I did when I called
<b>strcpy(him, "T.J. Houshmandzadeh");</b>), then strange things will happen.
They have explanations, but until you figure it out, it will be 
confusing.  If you're lucky, you get a segmentation violation or
a bus error.  If you're unlucky, you get wierd, inexplicable output.
A corollary of this is that when you get a segmentation violation,
a bus error, or wierd, inexplicable output, then chances are 
you have modified memory that you didn't allocate.  
<p>
Here's the output on my Mac in 2021 -- I may well make this a clicker question, but
see if you can figure out the output here.

<pre>
UNIX> <font color=darkred><b>bin/strcpy3</b></font>
give: 0x7ffeeea63197  him: 0x7ffeeea63192  six: 0x7ffeeea6318d
Give Him Six!
Houshmandzadeh T.J. Houshmandzadeh Six!
UNIX> <font color=darkred><b></b></font>
</pre>

<hr>
<h3>strcat()</h3>

<pre>
char *strcat(char *s1, const char *s2);
</pre>

<b>Strcat()</b> assumes that <b>s1</b> and <b>s2</b> are 
both null-terminated strings.
<b>Strcat()</b>
then concatenates <b>s2</b> to the end of <b>s1</b>.  I don't 
know what it returns -- read the man page if you care.
<b>Strcat()</b> assumes that there is enough space in <b>s1</b>
to hold these extra characters.  Otherwise, you'll start stomping
over memory that you didn't allocate.  Here is a simple example:
(this is in 
<b><a href=src/strcat.c>src/strcat.c</a></b>):

<p><center><table border=3 cellpadding=3><td><pre>
<font color=blue>/* Using strcpy() and strcat() to create the string "Give Him Six!" incrementally. */</font>

#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;
#include &lt;string.h&gt;

int main()
{
  char givehimsix[15];

  strcpy(givehimsix, "Give");
  printf("%s\n", givehimsix);
  strcat(givehimsix, " Him");
  printf("%s\n", givehimsix);
  strcat(givehimsix, " Six!");
  printf("%s\n", givehimsix);
  return 0;
}
</pre></td></table></center><p>

The output is predictable:
<pre>
UNIX> <font color=darkred><b>bin/strcat</b></font>
Give
Give Him
Give Him Six!
UNIX> 
</pre>
Look at <a href=src/strcat2.c><b>src/strcat2.c</b></a>.
Can you explain why the output is the way that it is?  Try filling in memory
as we did in the <b>strcpy2</b> example above.
<pre>
UNIX> <font color=darkred><b>bin/strcat2</b></font>
give: 0xbfffe060  him: 0xbfffe050  six: 0xbfffe040
Give Him Six!
deh T.J. Houshmandzadeh Six!
deh Help! T.J. Houshmandzadeh Help! Six!
UNIX> 
</pre>

C-style strings are a little more difficult to handle than C++ style strings.
For example, suppose you wanted to create a string with a given number of j's.
In C++, you might write the following
(<b><a href=src/makej.cpp>src/makej.cpp</a></b>):

<p><center><table border=3 cellpadding=3><td><pre>
<font color=blue>/* Create a string with a given number of j's by using string concatenation. */</font>

#include &lt;iostream&gt;
#include &lt;cstdio&gt;
#include &lt;cstdlib&gt;
using namespace std;

int main(int argc, char **argv)
{
  int i, n;
  string s;

  if (argc != 2) { fprintf(stderr, "usage: makej number\n"); exit(1); }
  n = atoi(argv[1]);

  for (i = 0; i &lt; n; i++) s += "j";    <font color=blue>// Here is the string concatenation.</font>
  cout &lt;&lt; s &lt;&lt; endl;
  return 0;
}
</pre></td></table></center><p>

Suppose you want to write the equivalent in C.  It's a little more difficult,
as you need to call <b>malloc()</b> first, to allocate the string.  However, 
here it is 
(<b><a href=src/strcat3.c>src/strcat3.c</a></b>):

<p><center><table border=3 cellpadding=3><td><pre>
<font color=blue>/* Trying to use strcat() like C++ string concatenation. */</font>

#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;
#include &lt;stdlib.h&gt;
#include &lt;string.h&gt;

int main(int argc, char **argv)
{
  char *s;
  int i;
  int n;

  if (argc != 2) { fprintf(stderr, "usage: strcat3 number\n"); exit(1); }

  n = atoi(argv[1]);
  s = (char *)</font> malloc(sizeof(char)*(n+1));
  strcpy(s, "");

  for (i = 0; i &lt; n; i++) strcat(s, "j");  <font color=blue>/* Here's the strcat() call, which is really inefficient. */</font>
  
  printf("%s\n", s);
  return 0;
}
</pre></td></table></center><p>


When you run them on small numbers, they appear equivalent:

<pre>
UNIX> <font color=darkred><b>bin/makej 50</b></font>
jjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjj
UNIX> <font color=darkred><b>bin/strcat3 50</b></font>
jjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjj
UNIX> <font color=darkred><b></b></font>
</pre>

However, try them on a really big number.  Here, I'm going to redirect standard output
to <b>/dev/null</b>, which throws it away, and I'm going to time it with <b>time</b>:

<pre>
UNIX> <font color=darkred><b>time sh -c "bin/makej 1000 > /dev/null"</b></font>
0.002u 0.004s 0:00.01 0.0%	0+0k 0+0io 0pf+0w                         <font color=blue> # Blink of an eye.</font>
UNIX> <font color=darkred><b>time sh -c "bin/makej 10000 > /dev/null"</b></font>
0.002u 0.004s 0:00.00 0.0%	0+0k 0+0io 0pf+0w                         <font color=blue> # Blink of an eye.</font>

UNIX> <font color=darkred><b>time sh -c "bin/strcat3 1000 > /dev/null"</b></font>
0.002u 0.004s 0:00.00 0.0%	0+0k 0+0io 0pf+0w                         <font color=blue> # Blink of an eye.</font>

UNIX> <font color=darkred><b></b></font>
</pre>

See the problem?  The C++ string maintains the string's length, so concatenation
is fast.  In contrast, <b>strcat()</b> has to find the end of the string at each
call, which makes the program <i>O(n<sup>2</sup>)</i>.  We can fix it, since we
know where the end of the string is.  This is in
<b><a href=strcat4.c>strcat4.c</a></b>:

<p><center><table border=3 cellpadding=3><td><pre>
#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;
#include &lt;stdlib.h&gt;
#include &lt;string.h&gt;

int main(int argc, char **argv)
{
  char *s;
  int i;
  int n;

  if (argc != 2) { fprintf(stderr, "usage: strcat4 number\n"); exit(1); }

  n = atoi(argv[1]);
  s = (char *) malloc(sizeof(char)*(n+1));
  strcpy(s, "");

  for (i = 0; i &lt; n; i++) strcat(s+i, "j");  <font color=blue>/* The only changed line */</font>
  
  printf("%s\n", s);
  return 0;
}
</pre></td></table></center><p>

<pre>
UNIX> <font color=darkred><b>bin/strcat4 50</b></font>
jjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjj
UNIX> <font color=darkred><b>time sh -c "bin/strcat4 100000 > /dev/null"</b></font>
0.003u 0.004s 0:00.01 0.0%	0+0k 0+0io 0pf+0w                        <font color=blue> # Back to a the blink of an eye</font>
UNIX> <font color=darkred><b></b></font>
</pre>

Such is life in C.

<hr>
<h3>strlen()</h3>

<pre>
size_t strlen(char *s);
</pre>

<b>Strlen()</b> assumes that <b>s</b> is
a null-terminated string.  It returns the number of characters
before the null character.  <b>Strlen()</b> is pretty obvious:

(this is in <a href=src/strlen.c><b>src/strlen.c</b></a>):
<p><center><table border=3 cellpadding=3><td><pre>
#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;
#include &lt;string.h&gt;

int main()
{
  char give[5];
  char him[5];
  char six[5];

  strcpy(give, "Give");
  strcpy(him, "Him");
  strcpy(six, "Six!");

  printf("%s %s %s\n", give, him, six);
  printf("%ld %ld %ld\n", strlen(give), strlen(him), strlen(six));
  return 0;
}

</pre></td></table></center><p>

Output:
<pre>
UNIX> <font color=darkred><b>bin/strlen</b></font>
Give Him Six!
4 3 4
</pre>

<hr>
<h3>strcmp() and strncmp()</h3>
<pre>
int strcmp(const char *s1, const char *s2)                     <font color=blue> # We use ints as bools in C.</font>
int strncmp(const char *s1, const char *s2, int n)
</pre>
<b>Strcmp()</b> performs a lexicographic comparison of two strings.  It returns 0 if 
they are equal, a negative number if <b>s1</b> is less than <b>s2</b>, and a positive
number otherwise.  You will use <b>strcmp()</b> quite a bit in this class, because
it's the easiest way to compare two strings.

<b>Strncmp()</b> stops comparing after <b>n</b> characters, if the null character has not
be reached yet.  It's a good exercise for you to do the <a href=http://web.eecs.utk.edu/~jplank/topcoder-writeups/2016/EqualSubstrings2/index.html>D2 250-point problem from 
Topcoder SRM 683</a> as a standalone program in C, using <b>strncmp()</b> and <b>strlen()</b>
rather than the C++ string library.  I'll probably do it in class.

<h3>strchr()</h3>

<pre>
char *strchr(const char *s, int c);
</pre>

<b>Strchr()</b> is how you perform "find" for single characters in C strings.
It assumes that <b>s</b> is
a null-terminated string.  <b>C</b> is an integer, but it
is treated as a character.  <b>Strchr()</b> returns a pointer
to the first occurrence of the character equal to <b>c</b> 
in <b>s</b>.  If <b>s</b> does not contain <b>c</b>, then
it returns <b>NULL</b>.
<p>

Here is a simple program that prints out whether each line of
standard input contains a space
(this is in <b><a href=src/strchr.c>src/strchr.c</a></b>):

<p><center><table border=3 cellpadding=3><td><pre>
<font color=blue>/* Use strchr() to determine if each line of standard input has a space. */</font>

#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;
#include &lt;string.h&gt;

int main()
{
  char line[100];
  char *ptr;

  while (fgets(line, 100, stdin) != NULL) {
    ptr = strchr(line, ' ');
    if (ptr == NULL) {
      printf("No spaces\n");
    } else {
      printf("Space at character %ld\n", ptr-line);
    }
  }
  return 0;
}
</pre></td></table></center><p>

Since you haven't seen <b>fgets()</b> before, go ahead and read the man page.
The arguments are a buffer of chars, the size of the buffer, and a "stream" from
which to read.  <b>stdin</b> is a global variable, defined in <b>stdio.h</b> that
specifies to read from standard input.  <b>fgets()</b> reads a line of text from
the stream, up to the number of characters specified.  It <i>will</i> include the
newline at the end of the line, which is often a pain.  Not so here, though.
<p>

I'm doing a little pointer arithmetic here -- <b>ptr-line</b>
returns the number of characters between <b>line</b> and <b>ptr</b>.
Here's an example of this running:

<pre>
UNIX> <font color=darkred><b>bin/strchr</b></font>
<font color=darkred><b>Jim</b></font>
No spaces
<font color=darkred><b>Jim Plank</b></font>
Space at character 3
<font color=darkred><b>James Plank</b></font>
Space at character 5
<font color=darkred><b> HI!</b></font>
Space at character 0
<font color=darkred><b>     HI!!</b></font>
Space at character 0
<font color=darkred><b>&lt;CNTL-D&gt;</b></font>
UNIX> <font color=darkred><b></b></font>
</pre>

We can modify this to print out where all the spaces are.  Check
out <a href=src/strchr2.c><b>strchr2.c</b></a>:

<pre>
UNIX> <font color=darkred><b>bin/strchr2</b></font>
<font color=darkred><b>Jim</b></font>
No spaces
<font color=darkred><b>Jim Plank</b></font>
Space at character 3
<font color=darkred><b>Jim  Plank</b></font>
Space at character 3
Space at character 4
<font color=darkred><b>  Give   Him   Six!!!</b></font>
Space at character 0
Space at character 1
Space at character 6
Space at character 7
Space at character 8
Space at character 12
Space at character 13
Space at character 14
<font color=darkred><b>&lt;CNTL-D&gt;</b></font>
UNIX> <font color=darkred><b></b></font>
</pre>

Go over the code -- why do I say 
<pre>
        ptr = strchr(ptr+1, ' ');
</pre>
instead of 
<pre>
        ptr = strchr(ptr, ' ');
</pre>
If you don't know, copy the code, modify it, and see for yourself!
<p>
If you want to find substrings rather than single characters, use <b>strstr()</b>
(read the man page).

<hr>
<h3>Scanf()</h3>

<b>Scanf()</b> is like <b>printf()</b> in that it takes a format string and some
parameters.  However, instead of writing the parameters to the terminal, it reads
from the terminal (or whatever is standard input).
Where <b>scanf()</b> confuses
people is that there are no reference variables in C, so you have to use pointers.
If you put <tt>"%d"</tt> in the format string, then <b>scanf()</b> will read an integer.
The parameter that you have to pass is a pointer to the integer that you want
read.  The storage for the integer has to exist.  <b>Scanf()</b> will read the
integer from standard input, and will fill in the four bytes of the integer.
<p>
Here's a simple example in
<b><a href=src/scanf1.c>src/scanf1.c</a></b>:

<p><center><table border=3 cellpadding=3><td><pre>
<font color=blue>/* Read a single integer from standard input using scanf. */</font>

#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;
#include &lt;stdlib.h&gt;

int main()
{
  int i;
  
  if (scanf("%d", &i) == 1) {
    printf("Just read i: %d (0x%x)\n", i, i);
  } else {
    printf("Scanf() failed for some reason.\n");
  }
  exit(0);
}
</pre></td></table></center><p>

I have one integer, <b>i</b>.  That's four bytes.  They are located at <i>i</i>'s
pointer: <b>&amp;i</b>.
When I call <b>scanf()</b>, I say
to read an integer from standard input, and fill in those four bytes with that
integer.  <b>Scanf()</b> returns the number of successful reads that it did.
If our read is successful, the program prints <i>i</i> in decimal and in hexadecimal.
<p>
<pre>
UNIX> <font color=darkred><b>bin/scanf1</b></font>
<font color=darkred><b>10</b></font>
Just read i: 10 (0xa)
UNIX> <font color=darkred><b>bin/scanf1</b></font>
<font color=darkred><b>Fred</b></font>
Scanf() failed for some reason.
UNIX> <font color=darkred><b>bin/scanf1</b></font>
<font color=darkred><b>15.999999999999</b></font>
Just read i: 15 (0xf)
UNIX> <font color=darkred><b>bin/scanf1</b></font>
<font color=darkred><b>-15.99999999999999</b></font>
Just read i: -15 (0xfffffff1)
UNIX> <font color=darkred><b>bin/scanf1</b></font>
<font color=darkred><b>&lt;CNTL-D&gt;</b></font>
Scanf() failed for some reason.
UNIX> <font color=darkred><b>echo "" | bin/scanf1</b></font>
Scanf() failed for some reason.
UNIX> <font color=darkred><b>echo 15fred | bin/scanf1</b></font>
Just read i: 15 (0xf)
UNIX>
</pre>

Let's go over these examples.
<UL>
<LI> The first successfully reads 10.
<LI> In the second,
I didn't enter a number, so the <b>scanf()</b> call made no matches.
<LI> In the third, <b>scanf()</b> stops reading when it decides that the input is no longer
an integer.  In this case, that's at the decimal point, so it successfully reads 15.
<LI> The same thing happens in the fourth case -- <b>scanf()</b> is not rounding off --
it's simply reading text until it decides that its no longer reading a number.
<LI> In the fifth case, I type <b>&lt;CNTL-D&gt;</b>, which ends standard input.
<b>scanf()</b> in this case returns <b>EOF</b> (defined in <b>stdio.h</b>).  It is
a negative number, so our program prints that <b>scanf()</b> failed.
<LI> In the sixth case, I use the program <b>echo</b> to provide standard input.
In this case, <b>echo</b> produces a blank line, so <b>scanf()</b> returns <b>EOF</b> again.
<LI> Finally, the last case uses <b>echo</b> again to show that <b>scanf()</b> will successfully
read the 15.
</UL>

<font color=red>(I usually skip this program in class, but enjoy reading about it here
if you're interested.)</font>
<p>
The program <b><a href=src/scanf2.c>scanf2.c</a></b> is buggy.

<p><center><table border=3 cellpadding=3><td><pre>
int main()
{
  int *i;

  printf("i = 0x%lx\n", (unsigned long) i);
  if (scanf("%d", i) == 1) {
    printf("Just read i: %d (0x%x)\n", *i, *i);
  } else {
    printf("Scanf() failed for some reason.\n");
  }
  exit(0);
}
</pre></td></table></center><p>

It will compile (although some nosy compilers will figure out it's buggy and yell at you).
Whether the bug manifests or not is a matter of luck.

Here's the program on my Mac in 2015:

<pre>
UNIX> <font color=darkred><b>echo 10 | bin/scanf2</b></font>
i = 0x7fff5fc01052
Bus error
UNIX>
</pre>

What happened?  The answer is that <i>i</i> is an uninitialized variable.  It randomly
started with a value of <tt>0x7fff5fc01052</tt>.
When <b>scanf()</b> tried to stuff the value 10 into
those four bytes, a hardware error was generated -- that's the bus error.  If you're
lucky, when your program has uninitialized variables, they lead to segmentation
violations and bus errors.  If you're unlucky, they won't, and you don't discover
your bug until (potentially much) later.
<p>
Just to test on some other machines,
here it is on my Raspberry Pi in 2018:
<pre>
@raspberrypi:~/CS360/cs360-lecture-notes/CStuff$ <font color=darkred><b>echo 10 | bin/scanf2</b></font>
i = 0x0
Segmentation fault
pi@raspberrypi:~/CS360/cs360-lecture-notes/CStuff$
</pre>

The fact that <i>i</i> was zero is good here -- the
segmentation violation clues us into the fact that there is a bug.
<p>
In 2018, my Mac gave me the disaster output:

<pre>
UNIX> <font color=darkred><b>echo 10 | bin/scanf2</b></font>
i = 0x7fff57c662a0
Just read i: 10 (0xa)
UNIX> <font color=darkred><b></b></font>
</pre>

The variable  <i>i</i> just happens to be a legal and aligned address.  The value 10 has
been stuffed into bytes 
<tt>0x7fff57c662a0</tt> to <tt>0x7fff57c662a3</tt>.  
Who knows what that is in my
program.  The fact that my program simply exits means that this bug is benign, but if I
were to have lots more going on in my program, this bug would be extremely difficult to
figure out.  The reason is that when the error manifests, it will be much later in the program,
when some other part of the program is using addresses 
<tt>0x7fff57c662a0</tt> to <tt>0x7fff57c662a3</tt>.  
This is why it pays to be careful when you are programming.

<h3>Strings and scanf</h3>

As we know, a string in C is an array of <b>char</b>'s.  Recall, a char is a one-byte integer,
which means that it has values between -128 and 127.  Each of those values matches
to a printable character, with zero equaling the "null" character.
A string is an array of chars that ends with the null character.  The following
program
(<b><a href=src/scanf3.c>src/scanf3.c</a></b>)
uses <b>scanf()</b> to read a string from standard input, and then to print
the individual characters:

<p><center><table border=3 cellpadding=3><td><pre>
<font color=blue>/* This program uses scanf and %s to read a string and print out the characters.
   You should *only* use scanf and %s if you are guaranteed that the string you are
   reading will not be bigger than the memory allocated to it.  Otherwise, you expose
   yourself to a buffer overflow attack. */</font>

#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;
#include &lt;stdlib.h&gt;

int main()
{
  char s[10];
  int i;
  
  if (scanf("%s", s) != 1) exit(0);

  for (i = 0; s[i] != '\0'; i++) {
    printf("Character: %d: %3d %c\n", i, s[i], s[i]);
  }
  exit(0);
}
</pre></td></table></center><p>

Since an array variable like <b>s</b> is equivalent to a pointer
to the first element, we do not have to pass <b>&amp;s</b>
to <b>scanf()</b> -- we simply pass <b>s</b>.
<p>
This program allows us to see the ASCII character codes for the characters
in the string "Jim-Plank":

<pre>
UNIX> <font color=darkred><b>echo "Jim-Plank" | bin/scanf3</b></font>
Character: 0:  74 J
Character: 1: 105 i
Character: 2: 109 m
Character: 3:  45 -
Character: 4:  80 P
Character: 5: 108 l
Character: 6:  97 a
Character: 7: 110 n
Character: 8: 107 k
UNIX> <font color=darkred><b></b></font>
</pre>

<b>Scanf()</b> with strings is problematic.  
In particular, think about what happens when you enter a string
with more than 10 characters.  Memory will get stomped on, just like the 
<b>strcpy()</b> and <b>strcat()</b> examples above with "T. J. Houshmanzadeh".
For example, let's send a string with 80,000 'j' characters to <b>bin/scanf3</b>:

<pre>
UNIX> <font color=darkred><b>bin/makej 80000 | bin/scanf3</b></font>
Segmentation fault: 11
UNIX> 
</pre>

We were lucky to get a segmentation violation -- allowing your input to stomp on your
memory is the heart of what's called 
a <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buffer_overflow>"buffer overflow attack"</a>.
Using <b>scanf()</b> with strings is a very good way to expose yourself to a buffer 
overflow attack, unless you can guarantee that your input actually behaves.  Using
<b>fgets()</b> and subsequently calling <b>sscanf()</b> is a safer way to go.

<hr>
<font color=red>(I often skip this, too.)</font>

<h3>Sscanf()</h3>

<b>Sscanf()</b> is just like <b>scanf()</b>, except it takes an additional
string as its first parameter, and it "reads" from that string instead of
from standard input.  It returns the number of correct matches that it
made.  Thus, it is quite convenient for converting strings to integers
and doubles.  It is far superior to <b>atoi()</b> and <b>atof()</b> because
it lets you know when it fails, which is quite important.
<p>
Here's an example program that reads lines of text from standard input,
and attempts to convert them to ints and doubles.  It is 
in <b><a href=src/sscanf1.c>src/sscanf1.c</a></b>:

<p><center><table border=3 cellpadding=3><td><pre>
#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;

int main()
{
  char buf[1000];
  int i, h;
  double d;

  while (fgets(buf, 1000, stdin) != NULL) {
    if (sscanf(buf, "%d", &i) == 1) {
      printf("When treated as an integer, the value is %d\n", i);
    } 
    if (sscanf(buf, "%x", &h) == 1) {
      printf("When treated as hex, the value is 0x%x (%d)\n", h, h);
    } 
    if (sscanf(buf, "%lf", &d) == 1) {
      printf("When treated as a double, the value is %lf\n", d);
    }
    if (sscanf(buf, "0x%x", &h) == 1) {
      printf("When treated as a hex with 0x%%x formatting, the value is 0x%x (%d)\n", h, h);
    }
    printf("\n");
  }
}
</pre></td></table></center><p>

Here is an example of it running.

<pre>
UNIX> <font color=darkred><b>bin/sscanf1</b></font>
<font color=darkred><b>10</b></font>
When treated as an integer, the value is 10
When treated as hex, the value is 0x10 (16)
When treated as a double, the value is 10.000000

<font color=darkred><b>55.9</b></font>
When treated as an integer, the value is 55
When treated as hex, the value is 0x55 (85)
When treated as a double, the value is 55.900000

<font color=darkred><b>.5679</b></font>
When treated as a double, the value is 0.567900

<font color=darkred><b>a </b></font>
When treated as hex, the value is 0xa (10)

<font color=darkred><b>0x10</b></font>
When treated as an integer, the value is 0
When treated as hex, the value is 0x10 (16)
When treated as a double, the value is 16.000000
When treated as a hex with 0x%x formatting, the value is 0x10 (16)

UNIX> <font color=darkred><b></b></font>
</pre>

The first four inputs should be straightforward.  That last one is a little
confusing, even to me, and the man page on <b>sscanf()</b> is not helpful.
From that, it appears that <tt>%x</tt> and <tt>%lf</tt> recognize "<tt>0x</tt>" in the input and 
perform the proper conversion in hex.  <tt>%d</tt> does not.   That's one of those
"features" on which I wouldn't rely -- I bet it's not implemented on all machines (that's
just my gut feeling).

<hr>
<h1>Strdup()</h1>

You'll be seeing more of <b>strdup()</b> in the Fields lecture, but I'll mention it now.
The prototype of <b>strdup()</b> is:

<p><center><table border=3 cellpadding=3><td><pre>
char *strdup(const char *s);
</pre></td></table></center><p>

It is basically implemented as follows:

<p><center><table border=3 cellpadding=3><td><pre>
char *strdup(const char s)
{
  return strcpy(malloc(strlen(s)+1), s);
}
</pre></td></table></center><p>


In other words, it makes a copy of the string, allocating memory for the copy.  
Since it calls <b>malloc()</b>, if you are finished with the copy, you should call <b>free()</b>
on it, to avoid memory leaks.  See how it uses the return value of <b>strcpy()</b> that 
we all ignore?  That's the only time you'll see that return value used.  
Again, we'll see more of <b>strdup()</b> in the Fields lecture.

<hr>
<h1>Other useful procedures</h1>

I don't go over these, but you'll use them from time to time.  It's good to be aware of
them.  Read their man pages.
<p>
<UL>
<LI> <b>strrchr()</b> find the last occurrence of a character
<LI> <b>strstr()</b> find a substring.
<LI> <b>strcasestr()</b> find a substring but ignore case.
<LI> <b>strsep()</b> helps you break up strings with delimiters.
<LI> <b>strncpy()</b> does a restricted strcpy.
<LI> <b>memcpy()</b> copies one region of memory into another.
<LI> <b>memcmp()</b> does a byte-by-byte comparison of two regions of memory.
<LI> <b>bzero()</b> sets a region of memory so that every byte is zero.
</UL>

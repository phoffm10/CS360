<pre>
Lecture about string manipulation in C -- you may want to do this on the lab machines.
<p>
- strcpy -- give him six example -- just look at it and don't write it.
- Do a strcpy that's too big in the middle string.
  Show memory.
- strcat -- givehimsix.
- If you care, overrun memory again.
- Do makej in C++ and naively in C.
- Show O(n^2) performance, and then fix.
- Strlen -- easy peasy.  But talk about performance.
- strcmp() -- show it.
- strchr() -- write the program to find the first space, and then to find all of the spaces.
- Talk about strstr() and strrchr().
- Talk about scanf if you care.  scanf1() reads ints
      scanf2 (optional) reads to an uninitialized pointer.
    Most definitely talk about scanf("%s") and buffer overflow attacks.  pipe makej into bin/scanf3.
- sscanf - already talked about.
- strdup - go over.
- Talk about other useful procedures that are at the end of the lecture notes.

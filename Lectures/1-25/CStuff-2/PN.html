<pre>
Define a pointer as an index into memory (using hex).

Do src/p3.c -- walk through it.  Then compile (ignore warnings) and print.

Show where in memory you find i and j.

And go over jp = j, as opposed to ip = &amp;i

Count up the bytes of local variables.

Different machines -- either show the Pi output or have a pi
accessible.

------------------------------------------------------------
Type Casting -- go over p4.c and the type castings.

Now revisit p3 and make the warnings go away.  Use a typedef.

------------------------------------------------------------
Ints and int *'s as "interchangeable":

Sometimes it feels convenient to interchange pointers and integers.  If you do, you
should use the long data type.  If you use an int, you'll get into trouble when
pointers are 8 bytes and ints are 4 bytes.  Look at src/p8.cpp and describe what it does.

The key line is when you set "s2 = i".  Run it and explain the seg fault.

Mention the compiler warning and how helpful it is.

Then show it on a pi with no warnings or seg faults.

Finally -- use a long instead of an int -- that's what's supposed to happen.
------------------------------------------------------------
Malloc and free.

No more new and delete.  Show the prototype for malloc & free.  Say what it does.
Talk about how to use sizeof() correctly in malloc.

Go over src/pm.c -- procedures to malloc and fill in.

Difference between C++ wrt malloc() and new: sh scripts/malloc-v-new.sh

------------------------------------------------------------
Seg faults and bus errors.

Talk about memory and how some of it exists and some doesn't.  Seg fault.
Address zero usually causes a seg fault.
Write the "hello world" of CS360.

And talk about bus errors.

------------------------------------------------------------
endian.c

Go over the program and the output that is in txt/endian_output.txt
Use the two pictures.

------------------------------------------------------------
Alignment within structs.

Talk about alignment within structs.  Then go over pd.c  Don't skimp on this.

------------------------------------------------------------
If you have time - look at src/pc.c

<h3>What you submit</h3>

You will submit the file <b>huff_dec.c</b>.  This must compile with:

<p><center><table border=3 cellpadding=3><td><pre>
gcc -Wall -Wextra -o huff_dec huff_dec.c -lm
</pre></td></table></center><p>

This means no Libfdr for this lab.  I'll give you some help on organizing your data structures
below.

<hr>
<h3>xxd</h3>

Do "man xxd".  You may find it a helpful program.  In particular, we'll be looking
at the output of <b>xxd -g 1</b> quite a bit.  Please read up on it.

<h3>Variable length encoding</h3>

Your job this week is to write a decoding program called <b>huff_dec.c</b>.
(When you compile it, put it into <b>bin/huff_dec</b> to make the gradescript work.)
<p>
The program takes two command line arguments -- a code defintion file, and an input
file.  It then uses the code defined in the code definition file to decode the input
file.  Its output is on standard output.
<p>
The code associates strings with sequences of bits.  For example, one code associates
the following strings with the following sequences of bits:

<p><center><table border=3>
<tr>
   <td>String</td>
   <td>Sequence of bits</td>
</tr>
<tr> <td>" "</td> <td>10</td> </tr>
<tr> <td>"\n"</td> <td>1100</td> </tr>
<tr> <td>"o"</td> <td>00</td> </tr>
<tr> <td>"p"</td> <td>010</td> </tr>
<tr> <td>"f"</td> <td>1101</td> </tr>
<tr> <td>"t"</td> <td>111</td> </tr>
<tr> <td>"the"</td> <td>011</td> </tr>
</table></center><p>

You'll note that no sequence of bits is a prefix of another sequence of bits.  This means that you can decode
a stream of bits into unique sequences.  For example:
<p><center>
111001001110111000101100
</center><p>
maps to this stream of unique  sequence of bits:
<p>
<p><center>
111 00 10 011 10 111 00 010 1100 = "to the top\n"
</center><p>
<p>
The code definition file defines the associations.  Its format is a stream of null-terminated
strings that come in pairs: the string and the sequence of bits defined as a stream of zero 
and one characters.  Thus, for example, the above code is stored in 
<b><a href=data/t-code.txt>data/t-code.txt</a></b>:

<pre>
UNIX> <font color=darkred><b>xxd -g 1 data/t-code.txt</b></font>
00000000: 6f 00 30 30 00 70 00 30 31 30 00 74 68 65 00 30  o.00.p.010.the.0
00000010: 31 31 00 20 00 31 30 00 0a 00 31 31 30 30 00 66  11. .10...1100.f
00000020: 00 31 31 30 31 00 74 00 31 31 31 00              .1101.t.111.
UNIX> <font color=darkred><b></b></font>
</pre>

The first string is "o", and it is associated with "00".  Next is "p", which is 
associated with "010", and so on.
<p>
The input file is in a specific format.  The <i>last</i> four bytes
represent an unsigned integer (in little endian), which says how many
bits should be read from the input file.  The preceding bytes contain
the stream of bits.  If the total number of bits is <i>t</i> then the
size of the file should be:
<p>
<center>
<i>ceil(t/8) + 4</i> bytes.
</center>
<p>
Within each byte, the stream of bits starts with the least
significant bit.  Thus, the stream "10000000" is represented by
the byte 0x1, and the stream "00000001" is represented by the
byte 0x80.  (That's backwards from how you usually view bites, but
it will actually make your life easier).
<p>
Let's look at
<b><a href=data/t-encoded.txt>data/t-encoded.txt</a></b>:

<pre>
UNIX> <font color=darkred><b>xxd -g 1 data/t-encoded.txt</b></font>
00000000: 27 77 34 18 00 00 00                             'w4....
UNIX> <font color=darkred><b></b></font>
</pre>


The last four bytes contain the integer 0x18, which equals 24.  Thus, the bit stream contains 24 bits, which
are stored in three bytes: 0x27, 0x77 and 0x34.  Converting them to a bit stream:

<pre>
    0x27 = "11100100"           <font color=blue> # Remember, the bits are "backward".</font>
    0x77 = "11101110"
    0x34 = "00101100"
</pre>
Yields the stream "111001001110111000101100" = "111","00","10","011","10","111","00","010","1100"  = "to the top\n".
<p>
Let's try another example, in 
<b><a href=data/t-encoded-2.txt>data/t-encoded-2.txt</a></b>:

<pre>
UNIX> <font color=darkred><b>xxd -g 1 data/t-encoded-2.txt</b></font>
00000000: 47 0c 0e 00 00 00                                G.....
UNIX> <font color=darkred><b></b></font>
</pre>

The last four bytes contain 0xe = 14.  Thus, the first two bytes contain a string of 14 bits:
0x47 = "11100010" and 0x0c = "00110000".  The string is "11100010001100" = 
"111","00","010","00","1100" = "topo\n".

<p>
Armed with this knowledge, you are now equipped to write <b>huf_dec</b>, which should decode the input
file using the code defined in the code definition file.  Use the C standard I/O library to read both 
the code definition file and the input file.  In other words, do <i>not</i> use the
Fields library -- it's actually not helpful here.  Instead, use <b>fread()</b>.


<p>
You may assume that the code definition file defines a code in which
no sequence of bits is a prefix of another.  You may also assume that
no string or sequence of bits is longer than 10000 characters.
<p>
You must test for the following errors:
<UL>
<LI> The code definition file is not in the correct format.  Do this at the beginning.
<LI> The input file is less than four bytes in size.
<LI> The size of the input file does not match the specified number of bits.  Do this after reading
     in the code definition file.
<LI> There is an unrecognized sequence of bits, or an incomplete sequence at the end of
     the bit stream.  Flag this error after you have decoded as much as you can.
</UL>

In each case, make sure your program outputs what mine does.
<p>
You may assume that the output of <b>bin/huff_dec</b> is composed solely of printable characters.
<p>
I used <b>fseek()</b> to read the last four bytes, and <b>fgetc()</b> to read the encoded bytes.
<p>
You don't need <b>math.h</b> to calculate the ceiling of an integer divided by an integer.
<p>

<hr>
<h3>Organizing your data structures.</h3>

Try something like the following:

<p><center><table border=3 cellpadding=3><td><pre>
struct huff_node {
  struct huff_node *zero;
  struct huff_node *one;
  char *s_zero;
  char *s_one;
};
</pre></td></table></center><p>

Organize nodes in a tree, where each node tells you what to do when you read a bit.
If the bit is 0 and <b>zero</b> isn't NULL, then you go to the next node for the next
bit.  If <b>zero</b> is NULL, then you emit the string in <b>s_zero</b> and start over.
Obviously, you handle 1 similarly.  If both <b>zero</b> and <b>s_zero</b> are NULL,
then that combination of bits has not been defined.
<p>
You can start with a single node at the root with all fields equaling NULL, and then
build the tree as you read the code file.  This will give you some good experience
with pointers and <b>malloc()</b>.
<p>
Here's a picture of the code above (the one in <b>data/t-code.txt</b>):

<p><center><table border=3><td><a href=img/t-code.jpg><img src=img/t-code.jpg width=500></a></td></table></center><p>

Hopefully that picture helps you think about your structure.  Once you understand that,
your code will be a lot cleaner if you group those fields into arrays:

<p><center><table border=3 cellpadding=3><td><pre>
struct huff_node {
  struct huff_node *ptrs[2];
  char *strings[2];
};
</pre></td></table></center><p>

<h3>Fun helper programs</h3>

The program <b>bin/huff_create_code</b> reads standard input and creates
a decent <i>Huffman</i> code from it on standard output.  It has an optional
first argument called <i>divisor</i>.  The default is 5.  If <i>divisor</i> is
zero, then the code is only composed of characters.  Otherwise, the program
determines all of the unique words in the file.  Suppose that number is <i>u</i>.
Then it also encodes the <i>u/divisor</i> most frequent words in the file.
That can lead to better compression.  The code is randomized, so if you run this
twice on the same input, you'll get a different code.

<p>
The program <b>bin/huff_create_code-2</b> takes no command line arguments, and 
produces a pretty crappy code.
<p>

If you're
bored someday, read about Huffman coding on Wikipedia: <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Huffman_coding>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Huffman_coding</a>.  

<p> The program <b>bin/huff_enc</b>
takes two command line arguments -- a code defintion file and the
name of an output file.  It then encodes standard input to the output
file using the code.

<h3>What you turn in</h3>

You should submit the program <b>jshell.c</b>.  The TA's will compile this with <b>libfdr</b>.

<hr>
<h3>Introduction</h3>

Time to write a shell.  Your job is to write <b>jshell</b> -- your own
shell, which is going to be very primitive.  <b>Jsh</b> is like <b>csh / sh / bash</b>:
It is a command line interpreter that lets you execute commands and 
redirects their input/output.  
<p>
The syntax is not like "regular" shells like <b>sh</b>, <b>bash</b> and <b>csh</b>.
It is more of a pain to use, but easier to write!

<HR><H3>The command format</H3>

<b>jshell</b> reads lines of text from standard input.  Commands are composed of multiple
lines.  Here's how to interpret each line (use the fields library):

<UL>
<LI> Blank line, or a line that begins with a '#': Ignore
<LI> A line whose first word is "<" -- this should have a single word after it, which you will
     interpret as a filename. You will redirect standard input from that file to the first
     child process of the command.
<LI> A line whose first word is ">" -- this should have a single word after it, which you will
     interpret as a filename. You will redirect standard output of the last child process in
     the command, to that file.
<LI> A line whose first word is ">>" -- this should have a single word after it, which you will
     interpret as a filename. You will redirect standard output of the last child process in
     the command, and append to that file.
<LI> A line composed of the word "NOWAIT".  This means
     that when you run the command, you will not wait for any of the child processes to exit.
<LI> A line composed of the word "END".  This means
     that the command is over and you should go about executing it.
<LI> Any other line is interpreted as an <b>argv</b> array for a child process in the command.
     You can specify any number of these, and when you execute the command, each child 
     process should be connected to the next via pipes -- standard output of child <i>i</i> goes
     to standard input of child <i>i+1</i>.
<LI> These lines can be specified in any order; however, when you read "END", you execute the
     command that you have been reading.
</UL>

<HR><H3>The first command line argument of my jshell</H3>

My <b>jshell</b> allows you to specify some letters on its first command line argument:

<UL>
<LI> 'r' -- a "READY" prompt will be printed at the beginning of the program, and after each
     "END" (after the commands corresponding to that "END" have been executed).
<LI> 'p' -- Before executing the command, this will print out what the command is.
<LI> 'n' -- The command will not be executed.  Combine this with 'p' to simply see what the
     commands are without executing them.
</UL>

See the examples below for more information about how these are specified and used.
<p>
BTW, your shell does not have to implement these. You may want to, to help you with debugging,
but I won't test them.  Here are some examples:

<HR><H3>You don't have to implement the first command line argument</H3>

The gradescripts do not call <b>jshell</b> with a command line argument, so you don't have
to implement 'r', 'p' or 'n'.  However, were I you, I would.  They don't have to match mine, but
they are useful for code development and debugging.

<HR><H3>Some General Advice</H3>

<h4>Incremental Programming</h4>

I would program in the following order:

<UL>
<LI> Executing one command.
<LI> Implementing NOWAIT
<LI> Redirecting stdin.
<LI> Redirecting stdout with ">".
<LI> Redirecting stdout with ">>".
<LI> Pipes
</UL>

Remember -- program slowly and test, test, test.  Think of things you should test, and then
test them.  Don't try to have the gradescripts be your debugger -- you'll be more efficient
thinking of things to test and testing them on your own before you move to the gradescripts.

<h4>Flush before fork</h4>

Before you call fork, you should call <b>fflush()</b> on
stdin, stdout and stderr.  Trust me.

<h4>Zombies</h4>

You should try to minimize the number of zombie processes that will
exist (this is in all parts).  This is not to say that they can't
exist for a little while, but not forever.
When you call <b>wait()</b> for a shell
command, it might return the pid of a zombie process, and not the
process you thought would return.  This is fine --- you just have
to be able to deal with it.  (i.e. consider the following sequence):

<pre>
<font color=darkred><b>cat f1</b></font>
<font color=darkred><b>> /dev/null</b></font>
<font color=darkred><b>NOWAIT</b></font>
<font color=darkred><b>END</b></font>
<font color=darkred><b></b></font>
<font color=darkred><b>vi lab3.c</b></font>
<font color=darkred><b>END</b></font>
</pre>

You are going to call <b>wait()</b> to wait for the <b>vi</b> command to
terminate, but
it will return with the status of the zombie process from the <b>cat</b> call.
This is all fine -- you just need to be aware that these things may
happen, and that you may have to call <b>wait()</b> again to wait for
<b>vi</b> to complete.

<h4>Open files</h4>

You must make sure that when you call <b>execvp</b>, that there are only
three files open -- 0, 1, and 2.  If there are others open, then you have
a bug in your shell.
<p>
Also, when a command is done, and the shell prints out its prompt, then
it should only have three files open -- 0, 1, and 2.  Otherwise, you have
forgotten to close a file descriptor or two and have a bug in your
code.  Check for this.   My <b>jshell</b> never uses a file descriptor
higher than 5.

<h4>Waiting in <b>jshell</b></h4>

If you do not specify "NOWAIT", then your shell
should not continue until <i>all</i> the processes in the pipe have
completed.  You'll need a red-black tree for this.

<h4>Errors</h4>

Your code should work in the face of errors. For example, if you
specify a bad output file at the end of a multi-stage pipe, then
the error should be noted, and your shell should continue working.
Make sure you check for all the error conditions that you can
think of.

<hr>
<h3>The Gradescripts</h3>

<UL>
<LI> The first 5 gradescripts test single commands.
<LI> The next 15 test NOWAIT.
<LI> The next 40 test redirection.
<LI> The next 40 test everything.
</UL>

As I said above, you'll do better to develop your own testing code than to use
the gradescripts when you develop code.  The gradescripts make use of the following
programs, which are in the lab directory:


<UL>
<LI> <b>cattostde.c</b>: This works like <b>cat</b>, but it prints what it receives
on  standard input, or on its input files to standard error.
<LI> <b>strays.c</b>: This checks for open file descriptors and will flag an error if any file descriptor
higher than three is open.  Then it works just like <b>cat</b>
<LI> <b>strays-files.c</b>: This works like <b>strays</b> except it copies the first argument to the second.
<LI> <b>strays-fsleep.c</b>: This works like <b>strays-files</b> except it sleeps for a 5th of a second before starting.
<LI> <b>strays-sleep.c</b>: This works like <b>strays</b> except it sleeps for a 5th of a second before starting.
</UL>

The gradescripts use all of these to test various features of your
shells.  Beside the first few gradescripts,
each gradescript call will take between 1 and 20 seconds.
The gradescripts are time sensitive, too, so the output of
your program may change as time passes -- for that reason, the
gradescripts can be a little hard to parse.   
<p>
To help you out, I have made videos to explain gradescripts 6, 21 and 61.
They are here:

<UL>
<LI> Gradescript 6: <a href=https://youtu.be/5bncxZZkzmU>https://youtu.be/5bncxZZkzmU</a>
<LI> Gradescript 21: <a href=https://youtu.be/DmRRy_h3TY4>https://youtu.be/DmRRy_h3TY4</a>
<LI> Gradescript 61: <a href=https://youtu.be/ndeR8cdct6c>https://youtu.be/ndeR8cdct6c</a>
</UL>

<h3> My command data structure </h3>

You don't have to use this data structure, but I put this here in case you'll find it
helpful.  This was the data structure that I used to store a command:

<p><center><table border=3 cellpadding=3><td><pre>
typedef struct {
  char *stdin;          <font color=blue>/* Filename from which to redirect stdin.  NULL if empty.*/ </font>
  char *stdout;         <font color=blue>/* Filename to which to redirect stdout.  NULL if empty.*/ </font>
  int append_stdout;    <font color=blue>/* Boolean for appending.*/ </font>
  int wait;             <font color=blue>/* Boolean for whether I should wait.*/ </font>
  int n_commands;       <font color=blue>/* The number of commands that I have to execute*/ </font>
  int *argcs;           <font color=blue>/* argcs[i] is argc for the i-th command*/ </font>
  char ***argvs;        <font color=blue>/* argcv[i] is the argv array for the i-th command*/ </font>
  Dllist comlist;       <font color=blue>/* I use this to incrementally read the commands.*/ </font>
} Command;
</pre></td></table></center><p>

A little commentary -- before I read END, I put commands into <b>comlist</b>, and keep 
track of the number of commands with <b>n_commands</b>.  I build the
<b>argv</b> array when I read the command, and that's what I put onto the <b>comlist</b>.
<p>
When I read <b>END</b>, I create <b>argcs</b> and <b>argvs</b> from <b>comlist</b>, and then
delete <b>comlist</b>. Since I'm storing the actual <b>argv</b> arrays in <b>comlist</b>, this
is a very simply process of calculating <b>argc</b>, and then copying the pointer to the
<b>argv</b> array.  
<p>
I have a procedure <b>free_command()</b> that frees everything in the data structure at the end
of every command.  I use this to handle errors while reading.
